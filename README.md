# hello-world
Just another repository


Hello,
I am new to coding. Very new.  My interests are web development.  I figure it's cheaper to learn how to do it than pay someone to do it.  Plus, I learn a new skill that will just benefit me.  I put around 5 hours a day into writing html and css.  I have played around with javascript but not very good.
